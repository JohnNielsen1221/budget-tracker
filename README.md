## General info
This program will allow you to add and subtract funds for an easy look at money management.

## Installation
Steps required to install project and how to get the development environment running:

- Clone the repo to your own system.
- Run npm install from the command line in the root directory
- Invoke the application with "npm start"

This will connect you to the localhost:3001 where you can test the app.

You may also test the app through the Heroku link listed in the links section.

Additionally, since this is a PWA, supported browsers will allow you to install the program as an App. After loading the page in a browser, you should see a + inside of a circle on the right side of the address bar. Click on this and follow the prompts to install the program as a local App.

## Functionality
This is a very simple program that allows you to add funds and subtract funds, each with giving ther transaction a name and an amount. The entries will be displayed, along with a graph showing you the changes in your budget over time. If you have been to the site before and are unable to connect to the internet, you will still be able to make transactions, and the next time you are connected to the internet your transactions will then be logged to the server.
